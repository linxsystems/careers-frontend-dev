# Linx Systems Tech II - Top 20 Songs App

Congratulations! You've been doing great and are a top contender. üëç

## App Instructions

1. Your App should have 2 bottom tabs - Home and Favorites. Home tab should have multiple sections of song carousels (United States, UK, Germany). Favorites tab should
   show a list of items in the Favorites list, and handle empty list.
2. Create a UI to show a horizontal carousel of songs. Carousel should be reusable, and have indicators for data loading and empty data. Each carousel item should have a          button to add the song to the Favorites list.
3. Make an API call to fetch from:
    * https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/api/v2/us/music/most-played/20/songs.json
    * https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/api/v2/gb/music/most-played/20/songs.json
    * https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/api/v2/de/music/most-played/10/songs.json
4. Setup the redux logic for toggling a song into the Favorites section. A song should only appear in this section once.

Refer to the given mockup to write a clean UI with good UX. Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production. Add any required dependencies to the package.json file.

We will setup a private slack channel for you to communicate with us and ask any questions. We encourage you to explain your thought process throughout this exercise.
